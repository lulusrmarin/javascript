# Vue Components
- __navigation.js__ - simple Bootstrap4 formatted navigation component with built in emission of selected values.  May not fit all cases due to a potential need to submit different values than the name of the navigation field.  It could be extended to use an object or array to allow for index/key separation to allow a separation in value and name of field, but for my uses so far that's overkill

- __google-oauth-2-login-button.js__ - The client half of the Ouath2 workflow for Google.  There is an ability to do this with pure javascript but it requires exposing your API key and Secret, which I'm not a fan of.  A more conservative way to do this would be to use Node or PHP.  I have a solution to each which will probably be uploaded at some point

Facebook buttons should be here sooner than later as well
